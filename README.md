The process for downloading the Python packages using ```pip install``` has been moved into the [dws-setup/](dws-setup/README.md) directory.

The new website is at [https://nbeney.github.io/codeclub-dws](https://nbeney.github.io/codeclub-dws).

It can be downloaded as single ZIP file or ```git cloned``` from [https://github.com/nbeney/codeclub-dws](https://github.com/nbeney/codeclub-dws) and installed locally at DWS.
